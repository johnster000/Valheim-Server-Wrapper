# Valheim-Server-Wrapper
Simple WinForms wrapper for Valheim Dedicated Server

Simply compile and run.
Once the program is open, you can go to the settings and define all the server details and folders where the script and world files live. 

Keep track of all the users and see whos currently logged in and for how long.

Feel free to play around with it, this is my first public repo!
